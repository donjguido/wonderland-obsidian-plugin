## INTRO (0:00 - 0:45)

### Hook (0:00 - 0:15)
[Screen: Empty Obsidian vault]

"What if every link you created could become a full note... instantly?"

[Click a link, note generates magically]

"That's Wonderland."

### Brief Overview (0:15 - 0:45)
[Screen: Title card with Wonderland branding]

"Hey everyone, I'm [name], and today I'm showing you Wonderland - an AI-powered Obsidian plugin I built that generates linked notes as you explore.

The idea is simple: you ask a question, AI creates a note with links to related concepts, and when you click those links... more notes appear. It's like falling down a rabbit hole of knowledge.

Let me show you how it works."

---

## DEMO: BASIC WORKFLOW (0:45 - 3:00)

### Starting a New Exploration (0:45 - 1:30)
[Screen: Obsidian with ribbon visible]

"First, let's start an exploration. I'll click the rabbit icon in the ribbon... or you can use the command palette: 'Enter Wonderland'."

[Open the modal]

"This is where the magic starts. I'll type a question I'm curious about..."

[Type: "Why do we dream?"]

"...select which Wonderland folder to use, and hit 'Down the rabbit hole'."

[Wait for generation]

"And there it is. AI generated an evergreen note about dreams, complete with links to related concepts."

### Exploring Links (1:30 - 2:15)
[Screen: Generated note with visible links]

"Now here's the fun part. See these links? They're concepts the AI thinks deserve their own notes. Let me click on one..."

[Click link like "REM sleep and memory consolidation"]

"Watch this..."

[Note generates]

"A new note appeared! And it has its own links. Each one is another rabbit hole waiting to be explored."

### Down the Rabbit Hole Section (2:15 - 3:00)
[Scroll to bottom of note]

"At the end of every note, you'll see 'Down the rabbit hole' - these are suggestions for where to go next. Just click one and keep exploring.

This is the core workflow: curiosity leads to notes, notes lead to more curiosity."

---

## SETUP & CONFIGURATION (3:00 - 4:30)

### AI Provider Setup (3:00 - 3:45)
[Screen: Settings page]

"Let's talk setup. In settings, you'll configure your AI provider.

Wonderland works with:
- OpenAI - GPT-4, GPT-4o-mini
- Anthropic - Claude models
- Ollama - free, runs locally
- Or any custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint

I'll use GPT-4o-mini for this demo. Just paste your API key and you're ready."

### Creating Wonderland Folders (3:45 - 4:30)
[Screen: Wonderland Folders section]

"Next, you designate folders as 'Wonderlands'. Each can have different settings.

For example, I have a Philosophy Wonderland for deep thinking, and a Cooking Wonderland with custom instructions to generate recipes.

Just pick an existing folder or type a name to create a new one."

---

## ADVANCED FEATURES (4:30 - 7:00)

### Custom Instructions (4:30 - 5:00)
[Screen: Folder settings]

"Each Wonderland can have custom instructions.

For my Cooking folder, I wrote: 'Generate notes as step-by-step recipes with ingredient links and cooking tips.'

Now every note in this folder follows that format."

### Folder Goals (5:00 - 5:30)
[Screen: Folder goal dropdown]

"You can also set folder goals:
- **Learning**: Optimized for understanding
- **Action-oriented**: Practical, step-by-step
- **Critical reflection**: Multiple perspectives
- **Research**: Evidence-based, citation-style
- **Creative**: Imaginative connections

These shape how AI generates content."

### Auto-Organization (5:30 - 6:00)
[Screen: Organization settings]

"Got too many notes? Wonderland can organize them into thematic subfolders.

Set it to auto-organize every X hours, or every X new notes, or trigger it manually."

[Show before/after of organization]

### Rabbit Holes Index (6:00 - 6:30)
[Screen: Rabbit Holes Index note]

"The Rabbit Holes Index shows all unresolved links in your Wonderland - every concept waiting to be explored.

It's like a dashboard of curiosity. Great for when you're not sure where to go next."

### Knowledge Enrichment (6:30 - 7:00)
[Screen: Enrichment settings]

"Finally, Knowledge Enrichment. This updates existing notes with insights from related notes.

Set it to run automatically, or trigger it manually. Choose whether to append new sections or integrate smoothly into existing content."

---

## MOBILE DEMO (7:00 - 7:30)

[Screen: iPhone/iPad recording]

"Wonderland works on mobile too! Same workflow - enter a topic, explore links.

One note: Ollama doesn't work on mobile since it requires localhost. Use OpenAI or Claude instead."

---

## TIPS & BEST PRACTICES (7:30 - 8:30)

[Screen: Text overlay with tips, show vault in background]

"A few tips I've learned:

1. **Start broad** - Big questions generate more interesting rabbit holes

2. **Trust the links** - AI suggestions often surface connections you wouldn't make

3. **Edit your notes** - AI drafts are starting points, not final products

4. **Use custom instructions** - Tailor each Wonderland to your domain

5. **Check the Index** - When stuck, see what's unexplored

The best knowledge bases grow organically through exploration."

---

## WRAP UP (8:30 - 9:30)

### Where to Get It (8:30 - 9:00)
[Screen: GitHub page]

"Wonderland is available now:
- Community Plugins: Search 'Wonderland' (pending approval)
- Or download from GitHub: [show link]

It's free and open source."

### Privacy Note (9:00 - 9:15)
"Quick privacy note: Your notes stay on your device. Only prompts go to your AI provider. No analytics, no tracking."

### Call to Action (9:15 - 9:30)
"If you try it, let me know what you think! I'm actively developing based on feedback.

And if it's useful, there's a Ko-fi link in the description.

Thanks for watching, and happy exploring!"
